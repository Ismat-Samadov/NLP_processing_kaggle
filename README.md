# Kaggle Competition Project: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This README provides an overview of my participation in the Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets Kaggle competition. It includes details about the competition, the dataset, my approach, and how to use the code to replicate or improve upon my results.

## Competition Overview

- **Competition Link:** kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started
- **Competition Description:**This particular challenge is perfect for data scientists looking to get started with Natural Language Processing.
